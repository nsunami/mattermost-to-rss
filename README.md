### Getting Mattermost IDs

To find the required IDs:

#### Using browser

1. **Team ID**: Go to System Console â†’ Teams, or check the URL when viewing your team
2. **Channel ID**: Go to System Console â†’ Channels, or use the API: `GET /api/v4/teams/{team_id}/channels`
3. **Bot User ID**: Go to System Console â†’ Integrations â†’ Bot Accounts, or use: `GET /api/v4/users/username/{bot_username}`

#### Using `mmctl` CLI

1. Install `mmctl` from your Mattermost instance
2. To get the channel ID and the team ID, run the command below, replacing the `NAME_OF_YOUR_TEAM` with your actual team name:

```bash
mmctl team list NAME_OF_YOUR_TEAM --json
```

This will return a JSON object. The `id` field in the object is the channel ID, and the `team_id` field is the team ID.

3. To get the bot user ID, run:

```bash
mmctl bot list
```

This will list all bot accounts. The first column is the bot ID.

### Bot Token Setup

1. Go to Mattermost â†’ Integrations â†’ Bot Accounts
2. Create a new bot or use existing
3. Generate an access token
4. Ensure the bot has permissions to read the target channel
